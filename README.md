I bring a creative, **value-oriented approach to building reliable and scalable solutions**. I focus on what truly matters: delivering features that make a difference, simplifying complexity, and ensuring long-term maintainability.


Outside of development, I enjoy playing boardgames, video games (I'm not creating them yet 😉) and reading books.
I also do a bit of running and weight training to keep myself healthy!
